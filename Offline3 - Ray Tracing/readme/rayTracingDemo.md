# Ray Tracing Complete Demo: From Camera to Pixel

## Overview

This document demonstrates the complete ray tracing pipeline from camera setup to final pixel color calculation. We'll walk through the entire capture function process, showing how rays are generated, traced through the scene, and how lighting calculations determine the final image using the same detailed step-by-step approach as the Phong calculation.

```

---

## Step 1: Camera Ray Generation

### 1.1 Target Pixel Selection
```
Target Pixel: (500, 350)  // Slightly right and down from center
Image Width: 800 pixels
Image Height: 600 pixels
```

### 1.2 Pixel to Screen Space Conversion
```
// Convert pixel coordinates to normalized device coordinates
x_ndc = (2.0 × pixel_x / image_width) - 1.0
y_ndc = (2.0 × pixel_y / image_height) - 1.0

x_ndc = (2.0 × 500 / 800) - 1.0 = 1.25 - 1.0 = 0.25
y_ndc = (2.0 × 350 / 600) - 1.0 = 1.167 - 1.0 = 0.167
```

### 1.3 Screen Space to Camera Space
```
// Calculate screen space coordinates
aspect_ratio = image_width / image_height = 800 / 600 = 1.333
fov_radians = 60° × π / 180 = 1.047 radians
tan_half_fov = tan(1.047 / 2) = tan(0.524) = 0.577

x_screen = x_ndc × aspect_ratio × tan_half_fov
y_screen = y_ndc × tan_half_fov

x_screen = 0.25 × 1.333 × 0.577 = 0.192
y_screen = 0.167 × 0.577 = 0.096
```

### 1.4 Primary Ray Construction
```
Camera Position: C = (0, 0, 10)
Camera Right: R = (1, 0, 0)
Camera Up: U = (0, 1, 0)
Camera Forward: F = (0, 0, -1)

Ray Direction = F + x_screen × R + y_screen × U
Ray Direction = (0, 0, -1) + 0.192 × (1, 0, 0) + 0.096 × (0, 1, 0)
Ray Direction = (0, 0, -1) + (0.192, 0, 0) + (0, 0.096, 0)
Ray Direction = (0.192, 0.096, -1)

// Normalize the direction
Length = √(0.192² + 0.096² + (-1)²) = √(0.037 + 0.009 + 1) = √1.046 = 1.023
Ray Direction = (0.192, 0.096, -1) / 1.023 = (0.188, 0.094, -0.978)

Primary Ray: Origin = (0, 0, 10), Direction = (0.188, 0.094, -0.978)
```

---

## Step 2: Ray-Scene Intersection Testing

### 2.1 Test Against Red Sphere
```
Sphere Center: C = (2, 1, 0)
Sphere Radius: r = 1.5
Ray Origin: O = (0, 0, 10)
Ray Direction: D = (0.188, 0.094, -0.978)

Vector from origin to center: L = C - O = (2, 1, 0) - (0, 0, 10) = (2, 1, -10)

Projection of L onto D: t_ca = L·D
t_ca = (2, 1, -10)·(0.188, 0.094, -0.978)
t_ca = (2 × 0.188) + (1 × 0.094) + (-10 × -0.978)
t_ca = 0.376 + 0.094 + 9.78 = 10.25

Distance squared from sphere center to ray: d² = |L|² - t_ca²
|L|² = 2² + 1² + (-10)² = 4 + 1 + 100 = 105
d² = 105 - 10.25² = 105 - 105.06 = -0.06

Since d² < 0, ray passes through sphere.

Half-chord length: t_hc = √(r² - d²) = √(1.5² - (-0.06)) = √(2.25 + 0.06) = √2.31 = 1.52

Intersection distances:
t₁ = t_ca - t_hc = 10.25 - 1.52 = 8.73
t₂ = t_ca + t_hc = 10.25 + 1.52 = 11.77

Closest intersection: t = 8.73
Red Sphere: HIT at t = 8.73
```

### 2.2 Test Against Blue Sphere
```
Sphere Center: C = (-1, -1, -2)
Sphere Radius: r = 1.0
Ray: O = (0, 0, 10), D = (0.188, 0.094, -0.978)

Vector from origin to center: L = (-1, -1, -2) - (0, 0, 10) = (-1, -1, -12)

Projection: t_ca = L·D = (-1, -1, -12)·(0.188, 0.094, -0.978)
t_ca = (-1 × 0.188) + (-1 × 0.094) + (-12 × -0.978)
t_ca = -0.188 - 0.094 + 11.736 = 11.454

Distance squared: d² = |L|² - t_ca²
|L|² = (-1)² + (-1)² + (-12)² = 1 + 1 + 144 = 146
d² = 146 - 11.454² = 146 - 131.19 = 14.81

Since d² = 14.81 > r² = 1.0, no intersection.
Blue Sphere: NO HIT
```

### 2.3 Test Against Green Plane
```
Plane Normal: N = (0, 1, 0)
Plane Distance: d = -3
Ray: O = (0, 0, 10), D = (0.188, 0.094, -0.978)

Plane equation: N·P + d = 0, so (0, 1, 0)·P - 3 = 0, meaning P_y = 3

Ray equation: P = O + t × D = (0, 0, 10) + t × (0.188, 0.094, -0.978)
P = (0.188t, 0.094t, 10 - 0.978t)

For intersection: P_y = 3
0.094t = 3
t = 3 / 0.094 = 31.91

Intersection point: P = (0.188 × 31.91, 3, 10 - 0.978 × 31.91)
P = (6.00, 3, 10 - 31.21) = (6.00, 3, -21.21)

Green Plane: HIT at t = 31.91
```

### 2.4 Closest Intersection
```
Red Sphere: t = 8.73
Blue Sphere: No hit
Green Plane: t = 31.91

Closest Hit: Red Sphere at t = 8.73
Intersection Point: P = (0, 0, 10) + 8.73 × (0.188, 0.094, -0.978)
P = (0, 0, 10) + (1.641, 0.821, -8.538)
P = (1.641, 0.821, 1.462)
```

---

## Step 3: Surface Properties at Intersection

### 3.1 Surface Normal Calculation
```
Red Sphere Center: C = (2, 1, 0)
Intersection Point: P = (1.641, 0.821, 1.462)
Radius: r = 1.5

Surface Normal: N = (P - C) / r
N = ((1.641, 0.821, 1.462) - (2, 1, 0)) / 1.5
N = (-0.359, -0.179, 1.462) / 1.5
N = (-0.239, -0.119, 0.975)
```

### 3.2 Surface Color
```
Surface Color: C_surface = (0.8, 0.2, 0.2)  // Red sphere color
```

### 3.3 Viewing Direction
```
Viewing Direction: V = -D = (-0.188, -0.094, 0.978)
```

---

## Step 4: Phong Lighting Calculation

### 4.1 Ambient Component
```
I_ambient = k_a × C_surface
I_ambient = 0.2 × (0.8, 0.2, 0.2) = (0.16, 0.04, 0.04)
```

### 4.2 Point Light Contribution

#### Light Direction and Distance
```
Light Position: L_pos = (5, 5, 5)
Intersection Point: P = (1.641, 0.821, 1.462)

Light Vector = L_pos - P = (5, 5, 5) - (1.641, 0.821, 1.462) = (3.359, 4.179, 3.538)
Distance = √(3.359² + 4.179² + 3.538²) = √(11.28 + 17.46 + 12.52) = √41.26 = 6.42

L = (3.359, 4.179, 3.538) / 6.42 = (0.523, 0.651, 0.551)
```

#### Shadow Testing
```
Shadow Ray: Origin = P + ε × N, Direction = L
Shadow Ray Origin = (1.641, 0.821, 1.462) + 0.001 × (-0.239, -0.119, 0.975)
Shadow Ray Origin = (1.641, 0.821, 1.462) + (-0.000239, -0.000119, 0.000975)
Shadow Ray Origin = (1.641, 0.821, 1.463)

Test against all objects:
- Blue Sphere: Assume no intersection
- Green Plane: Assume no intersection

Shadow Test Result: NO OCCLUSION
```

#### Diffuse Calculation
```
N·L = (-0.239, -0.119, 0.975)·(0.523, 0.651, 0.551)
N·L = (-0.239 × 0.523) + (-0.119 × 0.651) + (0.975 × 0.551)
N·L = -0.125 - 0.077 + 0.537 = 0.335

diffuse_factor = max(0, N·L) = max(0, 0.335) = 0.335

I_diffuse = k_d × I_light × C_surface × diffuse_factor
I_diffuse = 0.6 × (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) × (0.8, 0.2, 0.2) × 0.335

For each channel:
Red:   0.6 × 1.0 × 0.8 × 0.335 = 0.161
Green: 0.6 × 1.0 × 0.2 × 0.335 = 0.040
Blue:  0.6 × 1.0 × 0.2 × 0.335 = 0.040

I_diffuse = (0.161, 0.040, 0.040)
```

#### Specular Calculation
```
Incident Direction: I = -L = (-0.523, -0.651, -0.551)
Surface Normal: N = (-0.239, -0.119, 0.975)

I·N = (-0.523, -0.651, -0.551)·(-0.239, -0.119, 0.975)
I·N = (-0.523 × -0.239) + (-0.651 × -0.119) + (-0.551 × 0.975)
I·N = 0.125 + 0.077 - 0.537 = -0.335

Reflection Direction: R = I - 2(I·N)N
R = (-0.523, -0.651, -0.551) - 2(-0.335)(-0.239, -0.119, 0.975)
R = (-0.523, -0.651, -0.551) - 0.67(-0.239, -0.119, 0.975)
R = (-0.523, -0.651, -0.551) - (-0.160, -0.080, 0.653)
R = (-0.523, -0.651, -0.551) + (0.160, 0.080, -0.653)
R = (-0.363, -0.571, -1.204)

Normalized R = (-0.363, -0.571, -1.204) / √(0.363² + 0.571² + 1.204²)
|R| = √(0.132 + 0.326 + 1.450) = √1.908 = 1.381
R = (-0.263, -0.413, -0.872)

Specular Factor: R·V = (-0.263, -0.413, -0.872)·(-0.188, -0.094, 0.978)
R·V = (-0.263 × -0.188) + (-0.413 × -0.094) + (-0.872 × 0.978)
R·V = 0.049 + 0.039 - 0.853 = -0.765

specular_factor = max(0, R·V) = max(0, -0.765) = 0.0

I_specular = (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
```

### 4.3 Spot Light Contribution

#### Light Direction and Distance
```
Light Position: L_pos = (-3, 4, 3)
Intersection Point: P = (1.641, 0.821, 1.462)

Light Vector = (-3, 4, 3) - (1.641, 0.821, 1.462) = (-4.641, 3.179, 1.538)
Distance = √((-4.641)² + 3.179² + 1.538²) = √(21.54 + 10.11 + 2.37) = √34.02 = 5.83

L = (-4.641, 3.179, 1.538) / 5.83 = (-0.796, 0.545, 0.264)
```

#### Spot Light Cone Check
```
Spot Direction: S = (0.577, -0.577, -0.577)
Light Direction: L = (-0.796, 0.545, 0.264)

cos(β) = L·S = (-0.796 × 0.577) + (0.545 × -0.577) + (0.264 × -0.577)
cos(β) = -0.459 - 0.314 - 0.152 = -0.925

β = arccos(-0.925) = 157.9°

Cutoff Angle = 30°
Since β = 157.9° > 30°, the surface is outside the spotlight cone.

Spot Light Contribution: (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
```

---

## Step 5: Reflection Calculation

### 5.1 Reflection Ray Generation
```
Viewing Direction: V = (-0.188, -0.094, 0.978)
Surface Normal: N = (-0.239, -0.119, 0.975)

Reflection Direction: R_reflect = V - 2(V·N)N

V·N = (-0.188 × -0.239) + (-0.094 × -0.119) + (0.978 × 0.975)
V·N = 0.045 + 0.011 + 0.953 = 1.009

R_reflect = (-0.188, -0.094, 0.978) - 2(1.009)(-0.239, -0.119, 0.975)
R_reflect = (-0.188, -0.094, 0.978) - 2.018(-0.239, -0.119, 0.975)
R_reflect = (-0.188, -0.094, 0.978) - (-0.482, -0.240, 1.968)
R_reflect = (-0.188, -0.094, 0.978) + (0.482, 0.240, -1.968)
R_reflect = (0.294, 0.146, -0.990)

Reflection Ray: Origin = P + ε × N, Direction = R_reflect
Reflection Ray Origin = (1.641, 0.821, 1.462) + 0.001 × (-0.239, -0.119, 0.975)
Reflection Ray Origin = (1.641, 0.821, 1.463)
```

### 5.2 Reflection Ray Intersection Testing

#### Test Against Blue Sphere
```
Blue Sphere: Center = (-1, -1, -2), Radius = 1.0
Reflection Ray: Origin = (1.641, 0.821, 1.463), Direction = (0.294, 0.146, -0.990)

Vector from origin to center: L = (-1, -1, -2) - (1.641, 0.821, 1.463) = (-2.641, -1.821, -3.463)

Projection: t_ca = L·D = (-2.641, -1.821, -3.463)·(0.294, 0.146, -0.990)
t_ca = (-2.641 × 0.294) + (-1.821 × 0.146) + (-3.463 × -0.990)
t_ca = -0.776 - 0.266 + 3.428 = 2.386

Distance squared: d² = |L|² - t_ca²
|L|² = (-2.641)² + (-1.821)² + (-3.463)² = 6.975 + 3.316 + 11.992 = 22.283
d² = 22.283 - 2.386² = 22.283 - 5.693 = 16.590

Since d² = 16.590 > r² = 1.0, no intersection.
Blue Sphere: NO HIT
```

#### Test Against Green Plane
```
Green Plane: Normal = (0, 1, 0), Distance = -3
Reflection Ray: Origin = (1.641, 0.821, 1.463), Direction = (0.294, 0.146, -0.990)

Plane equation: P_y = 3
Ray equation: P = (1.641, 0.821, 1.463) + t × (0.294, 0.146, -0.990)
P = (1.641 + 0.294t, 0.821 + 0.146t, 1.463 - 0.990t)

For intersection: P_y = 3
0.821 + 0.146t = 3
0.146t = 3 - 0.821 = 2.179
t = 2.179 / 0.146 = 14.92

Intersection Point: P = (1.641 + 0.294 × 14.92, 3, 1.463 - 0.990 × 14.92)
P = (1.641 + 4.386, 3, 1.463 - 14.771) = (6.027, 3, -13.308)

Green Plane: HIT at t = 14.92
```

### 5.3 Reflected Surface Properties
```
Green Plane Intersection Point: (6.027, 3, -13.308)
Green Plane Surface Color: (0.2, 0.8, 0.2)
Green Plane Normal: (0, 1, 0)

Assume simplified lighting calculation at green plane intersection:
Reflected Color from Green Plane: (0.15, 0.5, 0.15)
```

### 5.4 Reflection Contribution
```
k_r = 0.1 (reflection coefficient)
I_reflection = k_r × Reflected_Color
I_reflection = 0.1 × (0.15, 0.5, 0.15) = (0.015, 0.05, 0.015)
```

---

## Step 6: Final Color Assembly

### 6.1 Color Accumulation
```
Final Color = I_ambient + I_diffuse + I_specular + I_reflection
Final Color = (0.16, 0.04, 0.04) + (0.161, 0.040, 0.040) + (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) + (0.015, 0.05, 0.015)
Final Color = (0.16 + 0.161 + 0.0 + 0.015, 0.04 + 0.040 + 0.0 + 0.05, 0.04 + 0.040 + 0.0 + 0.015)
Final Color = (0.336, 0.130, 0.095)
```

### 6.2 Color Clamping
```
Final Color = (min(1.0, 0.336), min(1.0, 0.130), min(1.0, 0.095))
Final Color = (0.336, 0.130, 0.095)
```

### 6.3 Gamma Correction
```
Gamma = 2.2
Final Color = (0.336^(1/2.2), 0.130^(1/2.2), 0.095^(1/2.2))
Final Color = (0.336^0.455, 0.130^0.455, 0.095^0.455)
Final Color = (0.606, 0.403, 0.350)
```

1. FOR each pixel (x, y) in image:
   
   2. Generate primary ray from camera through pixel
      - Convert pixel to screen coordinates
      - Calculate ray direction
      - Create ray with camera position as origin
   
   3. Trace ray through scene:
      - Test intersection with all objects

      - Clamp to valid range
   
   8. Store pixel color in image buffer

9. END FOR
```

### 7.2 Recursive Ray Tracing
```
traceRay(ray, recursion_level):
   
   IF recursion_level > MAX_DEPTH:
      RETURN (0, 0, 0)
   
   closest_intersection = findClosestIntersection(ray)
   
   IF no intersection:
      RETURN background_color
   
   surface_color = calculatePhongLighting(intersection, recursion_level)
   
   IF surface is reflective:
      reflection_ray = generateReflectionRay(intersection)
      reflected_color = traceRay(reflection_ray, recursion_level + 1)
      surface_color += reflection_coefficient × reflected_color
   
   RETURN surface_color
```

## Step 8: Performance Analysis

### 8.1 Computational Complexity
```
Image Resolution: 800 × 600 = 480,000 pixels
Objects in Scene: 3 (2 spheres + 1 plane)
Light Sources: 2 (1 point light + 1 spot light)
Maximum Recursion Depth: 5

Per-Pixel Operations:
- Ray generation: O(1)
- Intersection testing: O(n) where n = number of objects
- Shadow testing: O(n × m) where m = number of lights

## Step 9: Alternative Pixel Examples

### 9.1 Background Pixel (100, 100)
```
Target Pixel: (100, 100)
x_ndc = (2.0 × 100 / 800) - 1.0 = -0.75
y_ndc = (2.0 × 100 / 600) - 1.0 = -0.667

Ray Direction = (-0.75 × 1.333 × 0.577, -0.667 × 0.577, -1)
Ray Direction = (-0.577, -0.385, -1)
Normalized: (-0.477, -0.318, -0.827)

Intersection Test Results:
- Red Sphere: No intersection
- Blue Sphere: No intersection  
- Green Plane: No intersection

Final Color: Background Color = (0.1, 0.1, 0.2)
```

### 9.2 Blue Sphere Pixel (200, 200)
```
Target Pixel: (200, 200)
x_ndc = (2.0 × 200 / 800) - 1.0 = -0.5
y_ndc = (2.0 × 200 / 600) - 1.0 = -0.333

Ray Direction = (-0.5 × 1.333 × 0.577, -0.333 × 0.577, -1)
Ray Direction = (-0.385, -0.192, -1)
Normalized: (-0.359, -0.179, -0.933)

Intersection Test Results:
- Red Sphere: No intersection
- Blue Sphere: HIT at t = 12.5
- Green Plane: HIT at t = 35.2

Closest Hit: Blue Sphere
Surface Color: (0.2, 0.2, 0.8)
Lighting Result: (0.15, 0.15, 0.6) (after Phong calculation)
```
