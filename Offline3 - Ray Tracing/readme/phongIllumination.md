# Phong Illumination Model in Ray Tracing

## Overview

The Phong illumination model is a fundamental lighting technique in computer graphics that simulates realistic light-surface interactions. Named after Bui Tuong Phong, this model breaks down light reflection into three distinct components: **ambient**, **diffuse**, and **specular** reflection. In this ray tracing implementation, the Phong model serves as the core lighting engine that determines how surfaces appear under various lighting conditions.

The model works by calculating how light from multiple sources (point lights and spot lights) interacts with object surfaces, taking into account material properties, surface orientation, and viewing angles. This creates realistic shading effects including smooth color gradients, sharp highlights, and proper shadowing.

## High-Level Overview: What Actually Happens

### The Lighting Pipeline Journey

When a ray from the camera hits a surface in the 3D scene, the following process occurs:

1. **Ray-Surface Intersection**: The system determines exactly where the camera ray intersects with an object surface
2. **Surface Analysis**: The surface normal (perpendicular direction) and material properties are computed
3. **Ambient Lighting**: A base illumination level is applied to simulate environmental light
4. **Light Source Iteration**: For each light source in the scene (point lights and spot lights):
   - **Visibility Check**: Shadow rays determine if the light can reach the surface
   - **Diffuse Calculation**: Lambertian shading simulates rough surface scattering
   - **Specular Calculation**: Phong highlights simulate mirror-like reflections
   - **Color Accumulation**: Light contributions are added to the final pixel color
5. **Recursive Reflection**: If the surface is reflective, the process repeats for reflected rays
6. **Final Color**: The accumulated lighting produces the final pixel color

### Physical Simulation

The Phong model simulates three types of light interaction:

- **Ambient Reflection**: Represents indirect lighting from the environment (light bouncing off other surfaces)
- **Diffuse Reflection**: Simulates how rough surfaces scatter light uniformly in all directions (like chalk or paper)
- **Specular Reflection**: Models mirror-like reflections that create bright highlights (like polished metal or water)

### Mathematical Foundation

Each lighting component follows physically-motivated equations:
- **Ambient**: `I_ambient = k_a × surface_color × ambient_coefficient`
- **Diffuse**: `I_diffuse = k_d × light_color × surface_color × max(0, N·L)`
- **Specular**: `I_specular = k_s × light_color × (R·V)^shininess`

Where:
- `N` = surface normal vector
- `L` = light direction vector
- `R` = perfect reflection direction
- `V` = viewing direction vector
- `k_a`, `k_d`, `k_s` = material coefficients

## Conceptual Understanding: The Complete Picture

### What is Phong Illumination Really?

Imagine you're standing in a room with various objects - a shiny metal ball, a rough wooden table, a mirror, and a matte painted wall. When you turn on different lights, each surface responds differently to the illumination. The Phong model is essentially a mathematical recipe that teaches computers how to simulate these real-world lighting interactions.

### The Three Components of Light Interaction

**Ambient Lighting: The Room's Base Glow**
Think of ambient lighting as the gentle, even illumination that fills a room even when no direct light hits a surface. In real life, this happens because light bounces around the room multiple times - off walls, ceiling, furniture - creating a soft, overall brightness. Even in shadows, you can still see objects because of this ambient light. In our ray tracer, ambient lighting ensures no surface is completely black, giving every object a base level of visibility.

**Diffuse Reflection: The Matte Surface Story**
When light hits a rough surface like chalk, paper, or an unpolished wooden table, it scatters in all directions equally. This is diffuse reflection. The key insight is that how bright the surface appears depends entirely on how directly the light hits it. When light strikes perpendicular to the surface, it appears brightest. As the angle becomes more oblique, the surface appears dimmer. This is why a flashlight makes a brighter spot when held directly over a surface compared to when held at an angle.

**Specular Reflection: The Mirror Effect**
Shiny surfaces like polished metal, water, or glass don't scatter light evenly - they reflect it like mirrors. This creates bright highlights that move as you change your viewing position. The smoother the surface, the more focused and intense these highlights become. A chrome bumper has tiny, intense highlights, while a slightly rough plastic surface has broader, softer highlights.

### The Lighting Journey: From Light to Eye

**Step 1: The Light Source**
Imagine a light bulb (point light) or a flashlight (spot light) illuminating our scene. Each light has a position, a color, and an intensity. Point lights shine in all directions like a bare bulb, while spot lights create a cone of illumination like a flashlight or stage light.

**Step 2: The Surface Encounter**
When light from our source travels through space and hits an object's surface, several things happen simultaneously:
- The surface's material properties determine how it will respond to the light
- The angle at which light hits the surface affects how bright it appears
- The roughness or smoothness of the surface determines how the light bounces back

**Step 3: The Shadow Dance**
Before any lighting calculation happens, we need to answer a crucial question: "Can this light actually reach this surface?" If another object blocks the path between the light and the surface, we have a shadow. This shadow testing is like drawing an imaginary line from the light to the surface and checking if anything gets in the way.

**Step 4: The Material Response**
Each surface has a personality defined by its material properties:
- **Ambient Response**: How much of the room's ambient light it absorbs
- **Diffuse Response**: How much it scatters light like a rough surface
- **Specular Response**: How much it reflects light like a mirror
- **Reflection Response**: How much it acts like a perfect mirror

**Step 5: The Viewing Angle**
The final piece of the puzzle is where you (the camera) are looking from. Specular highlights and reflections change dramatically based on your viewpoint. A shiny surface might show a bright highlight from one angle but appear dark from another.

### Real-World Analogies

**The Photographer's Studio**
Think of how a photographer sets up lighting for a portrait:
- **Key Light**: The main light source (like our point light) provides the primary illumination and defines the subject's form
- **Fill Light**: Softer secondary lights (like ambient lighting) reduce harsh shadows and provide overall illumination
- **Rim Light**: Creates highlights on edges and shiny surfaces (like specular reflection)
- **Background Light**: Illuminates the background and creates depth

**The Artist's Canvas**
When an artist paints a still life, they observe:
- **Base Colors**: The natural color of objects (our surface colors)
- **Shadows**: Areas where light is blocked (our shadow testing)
- **Highlights**: Bright spots where light reflects directly toward the viewer (our specular component)
- **Form Modeling**: How surfaces curve away from light sources become gradually darker (our diffuse component)

### The Magic of Material Simulation

**Matte Materials (Paper, Chalk, Rough Wood)**
These materials are like tiny mirrors pointing in random directions. When light hits them, it bounces off in all directions equally. The result is a surface that looks the same brightness from any viewing angle, but whose brightness depends entirely on how directly the light hits it.

**Glossy Materials (Plastic, Semi-Polished Metal)**
These materials are partially organized mirrors. They scatter some light diffusely (like matte materials) but also reflect some light in organized directions (creating highlights). The balance between these two behaviors determines how glossy the material appears.

**Mirror Materials (Polished Metal, Glass, Water)**
These materials are like arrays of perfectly aligned tiny mirrors. They reflect light in very predictable directions, creating clear reflections of other objects in the scene. The smoother the surface, the clearer and more focused these reflections become.

### The Recursive Reflection Story

**The Hall of Mirrors Effect**
When you place mirrors facing each other, you see infinite reflections. Our ray tracer does something similar but controlled. When a ray hits a reflective surface, it bounces off and looks for what it would see in that direction. If it hits another reflective surface, it bounces again. We limit this process to prevent infinite calculations, typically stopping after 3-5 bounces.

**The Realism Factor**
This recursive reflection is what makes computer-generated images look truly realistic. Without it, metallic objects look flat and unconvincing. With it, they reflect their environment, creating the complex interplay of light and reflection we see in the real world.

### The Color Mixing Symphony

**Light Color Interaction**
When colored lights illuminate colored surfaces, they interact in realistic ways:
- A red light on a white surface creates a red appearance
- A red light on a blue surface creates a dark, muddy appearance
- White light on a colored surface shows the surface's true color

**Multiple Light Sources**
Real scenes have multiple light sources - sunlight through windows, artificial lights, reflected light from other surfaces. Our system handles this by calculating the contribution from each light source separately and then adding them together, just like real light behaves.

### The Performance Balance

**The Computational Challenge**
Every pixel in the final image requires these complex calculations:
- Testing shadows for every light source
- Calculating reflections that may bounce multiple times
- Combining contributions from all light sources
- Handling multiple objects that may block or reflect light

**The Optimization Dance**
To make this practical, we use various tricks:
- Skip calculations for lights that obviously won't affect a surface
- Limit the number of reflection bounces
- Use shortcuts for distant or dim light sources
- Optimize the order of calculations to exit early when possible

### Why Phong Still Matters

**The Foundation of Realism**
Despite being developed in the 1970s, the Phong model remains the foundation of most real-time graphics because it:
- Produces convincing results for most materials
- Runs efficiently on computer hardware
- Provides intuitive controls for artists
- Balances realism with computational practicality

**The Artist's Tool**
For computer graphics artists, the Phong model provides understandable controls:
- Want more realistic highlights? Increase the shininess
- Want a more matte appearance? Increase diffuse, decrease specular
- Want more reflective surfaces? Increase the reflection coefficient
- Want brighter ambient lighting? Increase the ambient coefficient

This conceptual understanding forms the foundation for appreciating how the mathematical formulas and code implementation work together to create the lighting effects we see in modern computer graphics.

## Class Structure and Implementation

### Core Phong Lighting Method

The main `phongLighting` method orchestrates the entire lighting calculation:

```cpp
void Object::phongLighting(Ray *ray, Color *color, int level)
{
    double tmin = intersect(ray);
    if (tmin < 0)
    {
        return;
    }
    Vector3D intersectionPoint = ray->getOrigin() + ray->getDirection() * tmin;
    Color intersectionPointColor = getSurfaceColor(intersectionPoint);

    // Ambient component
    color->setRed(intersectionPointColor.getRed() * materialCoefficients.getAmbient());
    color->setGreen(intersectionPointColor.getGreen() * materialCoefficients.getAmbient());
    color->setBlue(intersectionPointColor.getBlue() * materialCoefficients.getAmbient());

    Ray normalRay = Ray(intersectionPoint, computeNormal(intersectionPoint));
    Ray observerRay = *ray;

    // Point lights contribution
    computePointLightContribution(intersectionPoint, &observerRay, color, intersectionPointColor);
    
    // Spot lights contribution
    computeSpotLightContribution(intersectionPoint, &observerRay, color, intersectionPointColor);
    
    // Recursive reflection
    computeReflection(intersectionPoint, &observerRay, color, level);
}
```

**Line-by-line Analysis:**

**Line 3**: `double tmin = intersect(ray);`
- Calculates the distance from ray origin to intersection point
- Returns negative value if no intersection occurs

**Line 4-7**: Intersection validation
- Exits early if ray doesn't intersect the object
- Prevents unnecessary calculations for missed rays

**Line 8**: `Vector3D intersectionPoint = ray->getOrigin() + ray->getDirection() * tmin;`
- Computes the exact 3D coordinates where the ray hits the surface
- Uses parametric ray equation: `P = O + t*D`

**Line 9**: `Color intersectionPointColor = getSurfaceColor(intersectionPoint);`
- Retrieves the surface color at the intersection point
- May involve texture mapping or procedural color generation

**Lines 11-13**: Ambient lighting initialization
- Sets the base color using ambient coefficient
- Simulates environmental lighting that illuminates all surfaces equally
- Formula: `ambient_color = surface_color × ambient_coefficient`

**Line 15**: `Ray normalRay = Ray(intersectionPoint, computeNormal(intersectionPoint));`
- Creates a ray representing the surface normal at the intersection
- Essential for all lighting calculations involving surface orientation

**Line 16**: `Ray observerRay = *ray;`
- Stores the viewing direction for specular calculations
- Used to determine how light reflects toward the camera

**Line 18**: Point light contribution
- Processes all point lights in the scene
- Adds diffuse and specular contributions from omnidirectional lights

**Line 21**: Spot light contribution
- Processes all spot lights in the scene
- Similar to point lights but with directional constraints

**Line 24**: Recursive reflection
- Handles mirror-like reflections by tracing reflected rays
- Enables realistic metallic and glass-like materials

## Ambient Lighting Component

### Implementation
```cpp
// Ambient component initialization in phongLighting
color->setRed(intersectionPointColor.getRed() * materialCoefficients.getAmbient());
color->setGreen(intersectionPointColor.getGreen() * materialCoefficients.getAmbient());
color->setBlue(intersectionPointColor.getBlue() * materialCoefficients.getAmbient());
```

**Mathematical Model:**
```
I_ambient = k_a × C_surface
```

Where:
- `k_a` = ambient coefficient (0.0 to 1.0)
- `C_surface` = surface color at intersection point

**Physical Meaning:**
Ambient lighting simulates the indirect illumination that occurs in real environments due to light bouncing off multiple surfaces. It ensures that no surface is completely black, even in shadow areas.

**Implementation Details:**
- Applied independently to each RGB channel
- Multiplied by surface color to maintain realistic color relationships
- Controlled by material's ambient coefficient property

---

## Diffuse Lighting Component

### Core Calculation Function
```cpp
double Object::computeDiffuseComponent(Vector3D incidentDirection, Vector3D normalDirection)
{
    return std::max(-(incidentDirection * normalDirection), 0.0);
}
```

**Line-by-line Analysis:**

**Line 3**: `-(incidentDirection * normalDirection)`
- Computes the dot product between incident light direction and surface normal
- Negative sign accounts for direction conventions (light points toward surface)
- Result is cosine of angle between light and surface normal

**Line 3**: `std::max(..., 0.0)`
- Clamps negative values to zero
- Prevents "negative lighting" when light comes from behind the surface
- Implements Lambert's cosine law: surfaces facing away from light receive no illumination

### Application in Point Light Contribution
```cpp
// Inside computePointLightContribution
double diffuse = computeDiffuseComponent(incidentRay.getDirection(), normalRay.getDirection());

// diffuse reflection
color->setRed(color->getRed() + pointLight->getColor().getRed() * intersectionPointColor.getRed() * (materialCoefficients.getDiffuse() * diffuse));
color->setGreen(color->getGreen() + pointLight->getColor().getGreen() * intersectionPointColor.getGreen() * (materialCoefficients.getDiffuse() * diffuse));
color->setBlue(color->getBlue() + pointLight->getColor().getBlue() * intersectionPointColor.getBlue() * (materialCoefficients.getDiffuse() * diffuse));
```

**Mathematical Model:**
```
I_diffuse = k_d × I_light × C_surface × max(0, N·L)
```

Where:
- `k_d` = diffuse coefficient
- `I_light` = light intensity/color
- `C_surface` = surface color
- `N` = surface normal
- `L` = light direction

**Physical Meaning:**
Diffuse reflection simulates how rough surfaces scatter light uniformly in all directions. The amount of light reflected depends on the angle between the light source and surface normal, following Lambert's cosine law.

---

## Specular Lighting Component

### Core Calculation Function
```cpp
double Object::computeSpecularComponent(Vector3D reflectedDirection, Vector3D observerDirection, int shininess)
{
    return std::max(-(reflectedDirection * observerDirection), 0.0);
}
```

**Line-by-line Analysis:**

**Line 3**: `-(reflectedDirection * observerDirection)`
- Computes dot product between perfect reflection direction and viewing direction
- Negative sign accounts for direction conventions
- Result is cosine of angle between reflection and view vectors

**Line 3**: `std::max(..., 0.0)`
- Clamps negative values to prevent negative specular contribution
- Ensures specular highlights only appear when reflection aligns with viewing direction

### Reflection Direction Calculation
```cpp
Vector3D Object::getReflectionDirection(Vector3D incidentDirection, Vector3D normalDirection)
{
    return incidentDirection - normalDirection * (2 * (incidentDirection * normalDirection));
}
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
```
R = I - 2(I·N)N
```

Where:
- `R` = reflection direction
- `I` = incident light direction
- `N` = surface normal
- `I·N` = dot product (scalar value)

**Physical Meaning:**
This implements the law of reflection from physics: the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. The formula calculates the direction light would bounce off a perfectly mirror-like surface.

### Application in Lighting
```cpp
// Inside computePointLightContribution
Vector3D reflectedDirection = getReflectionDirection(incidentRay.getDirection(), normalRay.getDirection());
Ray reflectedRay = Ray(intersectionPoint, reflectedDirection);
double specular = computeSpecularComponent(reflectedRay.getDirection(), observerRay->getDirection(), shine);

// specular reflection
color->setRed(color->getRed() + pointLight->getColor().getRed() * intersectionPointColor.getRed() * (materialCoefficients.getSpecular() * pow(specular, shine)));
color->setGreen(color->getGreen() + pointLight->getColor().getGreen() * intersectionPointColor.getGreen() * (materialCoefficients.getSpecular() * pow(specular, shine)));
color->setBlue(color->getBlue() + pointLight->getColor().getBlue() * intersectionPointColor.getBlue() * (materialCoefficients.getSpecular() * pow(specular, shine)));
```

**Mathematical Model:**
```
I_specular = k_s × I_light × C_surface × (R·V)^n
```

Where:
- `k_s` = specular coefficient
- `I_light` = light intensity/color
- `C_surface` = surface color
- `R` = reflection direction
- `V` = viewing direction
- `n` = shininess exponent

**Physical Meaning:**
Specular reflection creates bright highlights that appear when the viewer looks in the direction of reflected light. The shininess exponent controls highlight size: higher values create smaller, more focused highlights (smoother surfaces).

---

## Point Light Contribution

### Complete Implementation
```cpp
void Object::computePointLightContribution(Vector3D intersectionPoint, Ray *observerRay, Color *color, Color intersectionPointColor)
{
    Ray normalRay = Ray(intersectionPoint, computeNormal(intersectionPoint));
    
    for (PointLight *pointLight : pointLights)
    {
        Ray incidentRay = Ray(pointLight->getLightPosition(), intersectionPoint - pointLight->getLightPosition());
        Vector3D reflectedDirection = getReflectionDirection(incidentRay.getDirection(), normalRay.getDirection());
        Ray reflectedRay = Ray(intersectionPoint, reflectedDirection);

        double distance = (pointLight->getLightPosition() - intersectionPoint).length();
        if (distance < epsilon)
        {
            continue;
        }

        if (!isInShadow(intersectionPoint, pointLight->getLightPosition(), distance))
        {
            double diffuse = computeDiffuseComponent(incidentRay.getDirection(), normalRay.getDirection());
            double specular = computeSpecularComponent(reflectedRay.getDirection(), observerRay->getDirection(), shine);

            // diffuse reflection
            color->setRed(color->getRed() + pointLight->getColor().getRed() * intersectionPointColor.getRed() * (materialCoefficients.getDiffuse() * diffuse));
            color->setGreen(color->getGreen() + pointLight->getColor().getGreen() * intersectionPointColor.getGreen() * (materialCoefficients.getDiffuse() * diffuse));
            color->setBlue(color->getBlue() + pointLight->getColor().getBlue() * intersectionPointColor.getBlue() * (materialCoefficients.getDiffuse() * diffuse));

            // specular reflection
            color->setRed(color->getRed() + pointLight->getColor().getRed() * intersectionPointColor.getRed() * (materialCoefficients.getSpecular() * pow(specular, shine)));
            color->setGreen(color->getGreen() + pointLight->getColor().getGreen() * intersectionPointColor.getGreen() * (materialCoefficients.getSpecular() * pow(specular, shine)));
            color->setBlue(color->getBlue() + pointLight->getColor().getBlue() * intersectionPointColor.getBlue() * (materialCoefficients.getSpecular() * pow(specular, shine)));
        }
    }
}
```

**Detailed Line-by-line Analysis:**

**Line 3**: `Ray normalRay = Ray(intersectionPoint, computeNormal(intersectionPoint));`
- Creates a ray representing the surface normal at the intersection point

**Line 11**: `double distance = (pointLight->getLightPosition() - intersectionPoint).length();`
- Calculates Euclidean distance between light source and intersection point
- Used for shadow testing and potential light attenuation

**Line 12-15**: Epsilon check
- Prevents numerical instability when light is extremely close to surface
- Skips lights that are essentially at the intersection point

**Line 17**: `if (!isInShadow(intersectionPoint, pointLight->getLightPosition(), distance))`
- Performs shadow testing to determine if light can reach the surface
- Only applies lighting if the surface point is visible from the light source

**Line 19**: `double diffuse = computeDiffuseComponent(incidentRay.getDirection(), normalRay.getDirection());`
- Calculates the diffuse component using Lambert's cosine law
- Result is the cosine of the angle between light direction and surface normal

- Result is the cosine of the angle between reflection and view directions

**Lines 22-24**: Diffuse contribution
- Adds the diffuse lighting component to each RGB channel
- Formula: `color += light_color × surface_color × diffuse_coefficient × lambert_term`

**Lines 26-28**: Specular contribution
- Adds the specular lighting component to each RGB channel
- Formula: `color += light_color × surface_color × specular_coefficient × (R·V)^shininess`
- `pow(specular, shine)` creates the characteristic highlight falloff

---

## Spot Light Contribution

### Complete Implementation
```cpp
void Object::computeSpotLightContribution(Vector3D intersectionPoint, Ray *observerRay, Color *color, Color intersectionPointColor)
{
    Ray normalRay = Ray(intersectionPoint, computeNormal(intersectionPoint));
    
    for (SpotLight *spotLight : spotLights)
    {
        Ray incidentRay = Ray(spotLight->getLightPosition(), intersectionPoint - spotLight->getLightPosition());
        Vector3D reflectedDirection = getReflectionDirection(incidentRay.getDirection(), normalRay.getDirection());
        Ray reflectedRay = Ray(intersectionPoint, reflectedDirection);

        double distance = (spotLight->getLightPosition() - intersectionPoint).length();
        if (distance < epsilon)
        {
            continue;
        }

        double beta = acos(incidentRay.getDirection() * spotLight->getLightDirection());
        beta = radianToDegree(beta);
        if (fabs(beta) > spotLight->getCutoffAngle())
        {
            continue;
        }

        if (!isInShadow(intersectionPoint, spotLight->getLightPosition(), distance))
        {
            double diffuse = computeDiffuseComponent(incidentRay.getDirection(), normalRay.getDirection());
            double specular = computeSpecularComponent(reflectedRay.getDirection(), observerRay->getDirection(), shine);

            // diffuse reflection
            color->setRed(color->getRed() + spotLight->getColor().getRed() * intersectionPointColor.getRed() * (materialCoefficients.getDiffuse() * diffuse));
            color->setGreen(color->getGreen() + spotLight->getColor().getGreen() * intersectionPointColor.getGreen() * (materialCoefficients.getDiffuse() * diffuse));
            color->setBlue(color->getBlue() + spotLight->getColor().getBlue() * intersectionPointColor.getBlue() * (materialCoefficients.getDiffuse() * diffuse));

            // specular reflection
            color->setRed(color->getRed() + spotLight->getColor().getRed() * intersectionPointColor.getRed() * (materialCoefficients.getSpecular() * pow(specular, shine)));
            color->setGreen(color->getGreen() + spotLight->getColor().getGreen() * intersectionPointColor.getGreen() * (materialCoefficients.getSpecular() * pow(specular, shine)));
            color->setBlue(color->getBlue() + spotLight->getColor().getBlue() * intersectionPointColor.getBlue() * (materialCoefficients.getSpecular() * pow(specular, shine)));
        }
    }
}
```

**Key Differences from Point Lights:**

**Line 16**: `double beta = acos(incidentRay.getDirection() * spotLight->getLightDirection());`
- Calculates the angle between incident ray and spot light direction
- Uses arc cosine of dot product to get the angle in radians

**Line 17**: `beta = radianToDegree(beta);`
- Converts angle from radians to degrees for comparison

**Line 18**: `if (fabs(beta) > spotLight->getCutoffAngle())`
- Checks if the surface point is within the spot light's cone
- Points outside the cutoff angle receive no illumination from this light

**Physical Meaning:**
Spot lights are directional light sources that emit light in a cone. Unlike point lights that illuminate in all directions, spot lights have a specific direction and a cutoff angle that defines the cone of illumination.

## Shadow Testing

### Implementation
```cpp
bool Object::isInShadow(Vector3D intersectionPoint, Vector3D lightPosition, double lightDistance)
{
    Ray shadowRay = Ray(lightPosition, intersectionPoint - lightPosition);
    
    for (Object *object : objects)
    {
        double t = object->intersect(&shadowRay);
        if (t > 0 && t + epsilon < lightDistance)
        {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

**Line-by-line Analysis:**

**Line 3**: `Ray shadowRay = Ray(lightPosition, intersectionPoint - lightPosition);`
- Creates a ray from the light source toward the intersection point
- Used to test if any objects block the light path

**Line 5**: `for (Object *object : objects)`
- Tests intersection with all objects in the scene
- Any object that blocks the light path will cast a shadow

**Line 7**: `double t = object->intersect(&shadowRay);`
- Calculates intersection distance along the shadow ray
- Returns negative value if no intersection occurs

**Line 8**: `if (t > 0 && t + epsilon < lightDistance)`
- Checks if intersection occurs between light and original surface
- Epsilon prevents self-shadowing due to floating-point precision errors
- Returns true if any blocking object is found

**Line 10**: `return false;`
- No blocking objects found, surface is illuminated

**Physical Meaning:**
Shadow testing simulates the occlusion of light by intervening objects. This is crucial for realistic lighting as it prevents surfaces from being illuminated by lights they cannot "see."

## Recursive Reflection

### Implementation
```cpp
void Object::computeReflection(Vector3D intersectionPoint, Ray *observerRay, Color *color, int level)
{
    if (level >= recursionLevel)
    {
        return;
    }
    
    Ray normalRay = Ray(intersectionPoint, computeNormal(intersectionPoint));
    Vector3D reflectedDirection = getReflectionDirection(observerRay->getDirection(), normalRay.getDirection());
    Ray reflectedViewRay = Ray(intersectionPoint, reflectedDirection);
    reflectedViewRay.setOrigin(reflectedViewRay.getOrigin() + reflectedViewRay.getDirection() * epsilon);

    Color *reflectedColor = new Color(0, 0, 0);
    double tmin2 = -1;
    Object *nearestObject = nullptr;

    for (auto obj : objects)
    {
        double t = obj->intersect(&reflectedViewRay);
        if ((t > 0) && (t < tmin2 || (nearestObject == nullptr)))
        {
            tmin2 = t;
            nearestObject = obj;
        }
    }

    if (nearestObject != nullptr && isPointVisible(reflectedViewRay.getOrigin() + reflectedViewRay.getDirection() * tmin2))
    {
        nearestObject->phongLighting(&reflectedViewRay, reflectedColor, level + 1);
        color->setRed(color->getRed() + reflectedColor->getRed() * materialCoefficients.getReflection());
        color->setGreen(color->getGreen() + reflectedColor->getGreen() * materialCoefficients.getReflection());
        color->setBlue(color->getBlue() + reflectedColor->getBlue() * materialCoefficients.getReflection());
    }

    color->red = std::min(1.0, color->red);
    color->green = std::min(1.0, color->green);
    color->blue = std::min(1.0, color->blue);
    color->red = std::max(0.0, color->red);
    color->green = std::max(0.0, color->green);
    color->blue = std::max(0.0, color->blue);
}
```

**Line-by-line Analysis:**

**Line 3**: `if (level >= recursionLevel)`
- Prevents infinite recursion by limiting reflection depth
- Typically set to 3-5 levels for realistic results

**Line 8**: `Vector3D reflectedDirection = getReflectionDirection(observerRay->getDirection(), normalRay.getDirection());`
- Calculates the direction of the reflected viewing ray
- Uses the same reflection formula as specular calculations

**Line 9**: `Ray reflectedViewRay = Ray(intersectionPoint, reflectedDirection);`
- Creates a new ray representing the reflected view direction
- This ray will be traced to find what the surface reflects

**Line 10**: `reflectedViewRay.setOrigin(reflectedViewRay.getOrigin() + reflectedViewRay.getDirection() * epsilon);`
- Offsets the ray origin slightly to prevent self-intersection
- Avoids numerical precision issues

**Line 16**: `for (auto obj : objects)`
- Finds the nearest object intersected by the reflected ray
- Similar to primary ray intersection testing

**Line 24**: `if (nearestObject != nullptr && isPointVisible(...))`
- Checks if reflected ray hits a visible object
- Ensures the reflected point is within the viewing frustum

**Line 26**: `nearestObject->phongLighting(&reflectedViewRay, reflectedColor, level + 1);`
- Recursively applies Phong lighting to the reflected surface
- Increments recursion level to prevent infinite loops

**Line 27-29**: Color accumulation
- Adds the reflected color weighted by the reflection coefficient
- Creates realistic mirror-like reflections

**Line 32-37**: Color clamping
- Ensures color values remain within valid range [0, 1]
- Prevents oversaturation from multiple light sources

## Material Properties

### Coefficients Class Structure
```cpp
class Coefficients
{
public:
    double ambient, diffuse, specular, reflection;
    
    Coefficients();
    Coefficients(double ambient, double diffuse, double specular, double reflection);
    
    double getAmbient() const;
    double getDiffuse() const;
    double getSpecular() const;
    double getReflection() const;
};
```

**Material Properties Explained:**

**Ambient Coefficient (0.0 - 1.0):**
- Controls how much ambient light the surface reflects
- Higher values make surfaces brighter in shadow areas
- Typical range: 0.1 - 0.3

**Diffuse Coefficient (0.0 - 1.0):**
- Controls how much light is scattered diffusely
- Higher values make surfaces appear more matte
- Typical range: 0.3 - 0.8

**Specular Coefficient (0.0 - 1.0):**
- Controls the intensity of specular highlights
- Higher values create brighter, more noticeable highlights
- Typical range: 0.1 - 0.9

**Reflection Coefficient (0.0 - 1.0):**
- Controls how much the surface acts like a mirror
- Higher values create more prominent reflections
- Typical range: 0.0 - 0.8

**Shininess (1 - 200):**
- Controls the size and focus of specular highlights
- Higher values create smaller, more focused highlights
- Typical range: 10 - 100

## Energy Conservation and Color Processing

### Color Channel Processing
Each RGB channel is processed independently using the same mathematical formulas:

```cpp
// Red channel example
color->setRed(color->getRed() + 
    pointLight->getColor().getRed() * 
    intersectionPointColor.getRed() * 
    (materialCoefficients.getDiffuse() * diffuse));
```

### Energy Conservation
In physically-accurate rendering, the sum of coefficients should not exceed 1.0:
```
ambient + diffuse + specular + reflection ≤ 1.0
```

This ensures that surfaces don't reflect more light than they receive, maintaining physical plausibility.

### Color Clamping
```cpp
color->red = std::min(1.0, color->red);
color->green = std::min(1.0, color->green);
color->blue = std::min(1.0, color->blue);
color->red = std::max(0.0, color->red);
color->green = std::max(0.0, color->green);
color->blue = std::max(0.0, color->blue);
```

Prevents color values from exceeding the valid range [0, 1], which could cause rendering artifacts.

## Mathematical Foundation

### The Complete Phong Equation
```
I_total = I_ambient + I_diffuse + I_specular + I_reflection
```

Expanding each component:
```
I_total = k_a × C_surface × I_ambient +
          Σ[k_d × C_surface × I_light × max(0, N·L)] +
          Σ[k_s × I_light × (R·V)^n] +
          k_r × I_reflected
```

Where the summation is over all light sources in the scene.

### Vector Mathematics

**Dot Product Significance:**
```
A · B = |A| × |B| × cos(θ)
```
For normalized vectors, this gives the cosine of the angle between them.

**Reflection Vector Formula:**
```
R = I - 2(I·N)N
```
Where I is the incident direction and N is the surface normal.

**Lambert's Cosine Law:**
```
I_diffuse ∝ cos(θ) = N·L
```
Where θ is the angle between the surface normal and light direction.

### Physical Interpretation

**Diffuse Reflection:**
- Simulates rough surfaces that scatter light uniformly
- Independent of viewing angle
- Depends only on light direction and surface orientation

**Specular Reflection:**
- Simulates smooth surfaces that reflect light like mirrors
- Depends on both light direction and viewing angle
- Creates directional highlights

**Ambient Lighting:**
- Simulates complex indirect lighting
- Provides base illumination in shadow areas
- Prevents completely black surfaces

## Integration with Ray Tracing Pipeline

### Usage in Ray Tracing
```cpp
// From main ray tracing function
if (nearestObject != nullptr) {
    nearestObject->phongLighting(const_cast<Ray*>(&ray), &color, 0);
}
```

### Pipeline Steps
1. **Primary Ray Casting**: Camera rays find surface intersections
2. **Surface Analysis**: Compute normals and material properties
3. **Lighting Calculation**: Apply Phong model with all light sources
4. **Shadow Testing**: Check light visibility for each light source
5. **Reflection Tracing**: Recursively trace reflected rays
6. **Color Accumulation**: Combine all lighting contributions

### Performance Considerations
- **Shadow Ray Complexity**: Each light requires shadow testing
- **Reflection Depth**: Recursive reflections can be expensive
- **Multiple Lights**: Computational cost scales with number of lights
- **Optimization Strategies**: Early termination, spatial acceleration structures

// Key light (bright, directional)
PointLight keyLight;
keyLight.setLightPosition(100, 100, 100);
keyLight.setColor(Color(1.0, 1.0, 1.0));

// Fill light (softer, opposite side)
PointLight fillLight;
fillLight.setLightPosition(-50, 50, 50);
fillLight.setColor(Color(0.5, 0.5, 0.5));
```
